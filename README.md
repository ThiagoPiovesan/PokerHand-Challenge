# Poker hand Rank:
---
## Concepts used:
- TDD;
- SOLID;
- Design Patterns.

---

## Objective:
The main purpose of these is to compare two poker hands and print who is the winner. Very simple, right?
No, actually we want to show the usability of the concepts shown earlier and apply then into a simple problem.
So, let's get it started!

---

## How does it work?
Using the main.py program, we give "two poker hands" as input. Like this:

- hand1 = "9C 9H 5C 5H AC"
- hand2 = "TC TH 5C 5H KH"
